What started as a shared concern for our local environment among seven friends has grown into a dedicated mission. We noticed the green spaces in our community fading and decided our friendship could be the catalyst for change. Armed with little more than a few shovels and a lot of determination, we organized our first drive. Today, a team united by a single goal: to leave our community greener than we found it."
